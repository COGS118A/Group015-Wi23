    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Police brutality has been a contentious political topic in the United States for decades. While this issue has seemingly gained more public attention over the evolution of the social media era, abuse of power by law enforcement has actually been a source of turmoil ever since the beginning of the 20th century. In the 1920’s, urban police departments, especially in the large cities of Chicago and New York, performed extralegal tactics against Italian-immigrant communities in order to “crack down” on organized crime [<sup>1</sup>](#lorenznote). The Los Angeles Police Department took part in attacks on Mexican Americans during the Zoot Suit Riots of 1943. Harassment of homosexual and transgender people by police was found as a “regularity” in 1969 New York, which culminated in the 1969 Stonewall Riots. And, most recently, this issue has shifted towards a race war between officers that abuse their power and the African–American community, with the likes of Rodney King, Michael Brown, Freddie Gray, Tamir Rice, Treyvon Martin, George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and so many more falling victim to unjust treatment from law enforcement. Over a 5 year period beginning in 2015, more than 11,000 claims or lawsuits were filed against the New York Police Department, alleging some form of police misconduct and several threats to public safety [<sup>2</sup>](#admonishnote). Of those complaints, more than half of them were solved by some form of lawsuit. While that sounds good on paper, about 530 of those were paid out as `$5000` or less, with most claimants in this group often receiving less than `$500`. In addition, according to the Commission to Combat Police Corruption’s 20th annual report, just over 11% of New York police officers that should have faced disciplinary action for occupational malpractice walked away with no punishment whatsoever, and were able to continue working as a police officer like nothing had happened [<sup>3</sup>](#ccpcnote). Point being, New York police officers are not receiving the punishments they deserve in response to valid complaints from the general public. The impact of police misconduct is much more complex than affecting the individuals that have first-hand experience with violence by law enforcement. These ongoing issues are a constant reminder, especially to minorities, that there is little hope for justice. Police brutality is, unsurprisingly, linked to poor health outcomes for those most affected. One research study found that intersecting pathways between police brutality and life-changing health outcomes include: (1) fatal injuries that increase population-specific mortality rates; (2) adverse physiological responses that increase morbidity; (3) racist public reactions that cause stress; (4) arrests, incarcerations, and legal, medical, and funeral bills that cause financial strain; and (5) integrated oppressive structures that cause systematic disempowerment [<sup>4</sup>](#healthnote). The above issues raise even more importance to our problem, as one inadequate police punishment has a ripple effect that extends far beyond the immediate victim at that particular time. Police brutality has lifelong implications. If one abusive encounter with a police officer can detrimentally affect one’s life to the point of fatality, why should the public trust a system that fails to serve justice for these victims through a lifelong punishment for the officer that fueled the outcome of the encounter? America desperately needs a new system to rightfully condemn law enforcement that fails to protect the public. Public trust in law enforcement is at an all-time low. Something NEEDS to be done.\n",
    "\n",
    "With that in mind, our goal is to gain more insight into the complaints given by civilians against police officers. While developing the scope of our project, we were inspired by a 2019 study conducted by the GBD Police Violence US Subnational Collaborators, a research paper that details unreported police killings across the United States from 1980-2019 [<sup>5</sup>](#fatalnote). This group found that across all races and states in the USA, 17,100 of the 30,800 deaths from police violence between 1980 and 2018 were unreported by the NVSS (USA National Vital Statistics System). Over this time period, the age-standardized mortality rate due to police violence was highest in non-Hispanic Black people (0.69 [95% CI 0.67–0.71] per 100,000), followed by Hispanic people of any race (0.35 [0.34–0.36]), non-Hispanic White people (0.20 [0.19–0.20]), and non-Hispanic people of other races (0.15 [0.14–0.16]). Besides the eye-opening statistics to further prove the importance of our issue, we aim to achieve this level of transparency and preciseness in our findings regarding applicable police punishment. Moreover, while our project will not directly detail the subject of unreported police killings by race, prior research like this gives us more inspiration to extend upon the information that is already out there, develop a mathematical-driven system that can further prove police officers deserving viable punishment for every-day malpractice, and highlight the significance of organizations like The New York City Civilian Complaint Review Board (CCRB) in an effort to go against the notion of unreported police malpractice. On that note, the CCRB is an independent organization that investigates and recommends viable punishment against New York City police officers accused of abusing their authority through the likes of offensive language, discourtesy, and unnecessary force [<sup>6</sup>](#ccrbnote). Why New York City? Besides being one of the largest cities in America with an immense history of police brutality, New York City is also home to the largest police force on the globe, with over 50,000 active personnel [<sup>7</sup>](#levinnote). Therefore, this city’s police department acts as an important role model for other departments, which is why it is of great importance for the NYPD to lead by example and be held accountable when a citizen raises a complaint against one of their officers. Due to this role, the city of New York and the CCRB maintains ongoing, publicly available data regarding official complaints raised to the CCRB that keeps track of poor encounters with police officers in the city. The data includes, but is not limited to, the subject of the complaint, victim age and gender, and, most importantly, the overall punishment the CCRB gave the accused officer. We will utilize a classification algorithm to find overall patterns and trends between the instances of day-by-day police misconduct detailed in our datasets in an effort to generalize our results and precisely predict whether the CCRB declared a complaint to be substantiated or unsubstantiated. More specifically, we want to be able to obtain a clear understanding between the characteristics of each complaint to determine several baseline criteria that ultimately decides the occupational fate of an officer subject to one of these grievances. We believe that our model will enable us to effectively determine whether or not the CCRB is recommending enough punishment to the “bad apples” of the NYPD, while giving us the opportunity to discover any specific trends or examples of misconduct that tend to lead to more severe punishment for the police officer at hand.\n",

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering that predicting whether a complaint is substantiated or unsubstantiated is a binary task, we want to utilize a classification model that can predict whether the CCRB declared a complaint as substantiated or unsubstantiated, which is described as the recommendation made by the CCRB based on the characteristics of the given complaint. In other words, we intend to understand exactly how the CCRB punishment categorization is obtained through the likes of our other key variables. In order to achieve our goal of determining whether the CCRB is recommending appropriate punishment for NYPD officers accused of abusing their authority, we must fit the best prediction model (with the most appropriate features) to our data at hand, measure the model’s performance through an F1-score, and generalize our results to the ongoing police brutality issues in America. At the end of the day, we wish to discover an ultimate baseline for public actions that are currently constituting poor behavior in police officers, and the consequences agencies like the CCRB can continue to enforce (and improve on) when condemning police that go against their oath to protect the public."
