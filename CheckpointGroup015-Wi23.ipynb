    "# Abstract \n",
    "Police brutality and abuse of power by law enforcement is a societal issue that has been ongoing in the United States, and has resulted in public distrust and social unrest. The goal of this project is to gain insight into complaints made by civilians living in New York City against police officers. We aim to develop a mathematically-driven system that highlights the significance of organizations like The New York City Civilian Complaint Review Board (CCRB) to ensure police officers are held accountable for their actions. Using data from the CCRB, we will analyze the nature of public complaints and the outcomes of disciplinary actions by wrangling our data, obtaining our most important features, and fitting the best prediction model possible. These steps will be made all in effort to generate correlational patterns within our data that shows us what kinds of complaints are unsubstantiated (the officer in question is not remediated) and substantiaed (the officer is remediated as a result of the investigation). The success of our model will ultimately be measured by its effectiveness in successfully identifying complaints that are substantiated. We will also utilize an F1-score to compute the model’s performance, leading us towards our vision of generalizing these results to combat the rising tension between the general public and law enforcement."

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Police officers being accused of abusing their authority has been a contentious topic in the United States for decades. While this issue has seemingly gained more public attention over the evolution of the social media era, abuse of power by law enforcement has actually been a source of turmoil ever since the beginning of the 20th century. Over a five year period beginning in 2015, more than 11,000 claims or lawsuits were filed against the New York Police Department, alleging some form of police misconduct and several threats to public safety [<sup>1</sup>](#lorenznote). Of those complaints, more than half of them were solved by some form of a lawsuit. About 530 of those lawsuits were paid out in the amount of up to `$5000`, but most claimants in this group often received less than `$500`. In addition, according to the Commission to Combat Police Corruption’s 20th annual report, just over 11% of New York police officers who should have faced disciplinary action for occupational malpractice walked away with no punishment whatsoever and were able to continue their work in the police force [<sup>2</sup>](#admonishnote). One research study found that intersecting pathways between police brutality and life-changing health outcomes include 1) fatal injuries that increase population-specific mortality rates, 2) adverse physiological responses that increase morbidity, 3) racist public reactions that cause stress, 4) arrests, incarcerations, and legal, medical, and funeral bills that cause financial strain, and 5) integrated oppressive structures that cause systematic disempowerment [<sup>3</sup>](#ccpcnote). The above issues raise even more importance to our problem, as police brutality on an individual level can have lifelong implications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to gain more insight into the complaints given by civilians against police officers. While developing the scope of our project, we partially took inspiration from a 2019 study conducted by the GBD Police Violence US Subnational Collaborators, a research paper that details unreported police killings across the United States from 1980-2019 [<sup>4</sup>](#healthnote). This group found that across all races and states in the USA, 17,100 of the 30,800 deaths from police violence between 1980 and 2018 were unreported by the NVSS (USA National Vital Statistics System). Over this time period, the age-standardized mortality rate due to police violence was highest in non-Hispanic Black people (0.69 [95% CI 0.67–0.71] per 100,000), followed by Hispanic people of any race (0.35 [0.34–0.36]), non-Hispanic White people (0.20 [0.19–0.20]), and non-Hispanic people of other races (0.15 [0.14–0.16]). Besides the eye-opening statistics to further prove the importance of our issue, we aim to achieve this level of transparency and preciseness in our findings regarding applicable police punishment. Moreover, while our project will not directly detail the subject of unreported police killings by race, prior research such as this one gives us more inspiration to extend upon the information that is publicly available, develop a mathematical-driven system that can identify cases where police officers should be remediated for their actions against a civilian, and highlight the significance of organizations like The New York City Civilian Complaint Review Board (CCRB) in an effort to go against the notion of unreported police malpractice. On that note, the CCRB is an independent organization that investigates and recommends viable punishment against New York City police officers accused of abusing their authority through the likes of offensive language, discourtesy, and unnecessary force. Why New York City? Besides being one of the largest cities in America with an immense history of police brutality, New York City is also home to the largest police force on the globe, with over 50,000 active personnel. Therefore, this city’s police department acts as an important role model for other departments, which is why it is of great importance for the NYPD to lead by example and be held accountable when a citizen raises a complaint against one of their officers. Due to this role, the city of New York and the CCRB maintains ongoing, publicly available data regarding official complaints raised to the CCRB that keeps track of poor encounters with police officers in the city. The data includes, but is not limited to, the subject of the complaint, victim age and gender, and, most importantly, the overall punishment the CCRB gave the accused officer. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will utilize several classification algorithms to find overall patterns and trends between the instances of day-by-day police misconduct detailed in our datasets in an effort to generalize our results and precisely predict whether the CCRB declared a complaint to be substantiated or unsubstantiated. More specifically, we want to be able to obtain a clear understanding between the characteristics of each complaint to determine several baseline criteria that ultimately decides the occupational fate of an officer subject to one of these grievances. We believe that our model will enable us to effectively determine whether or not the CCRB is recommending enough punishment to the “bad apples” of the NYPD, while giving us the opportunity to discover any specific trends or examples of misconduct that tend to lead to more severe punishment for the police officer at hand.\n"

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand whether the Civilian Complaint Review Board (CCRB) recommends appropriate action for NYPD officers accused of abusing their authority, we will first perform an exploratory data analysis to identify underlying patterns and trends in the data. EDA is going to be an essential step for our project, as it helps us to make informed decisions about which features to include in our model. Our EDA will include the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data Cleaning/Preprocessing: We will first inspect the dataset for inconsistent values and perform any necessary cleaning and preprocessing tasks to ensure the data is ready for analysis. We will focus on utilizing one-hot encoding for any missing values we may find.\n",
    "2. Descriptive Statistics: We will use summary statistics and visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and box plots to gain an overall understanding of the distribution and relationships between our variables.\n",
    "3. Correlation Analysis: We will conduct a correlation analysis to determine the strength and direction of the relationships between the variables. This will allow us to identify any multicollinearity issues that may arise from including highly correlated variables in our model.\n",
    "4. Feature Selection: Based on the insights gained from the previous steps, we will select a subset of features that are most relevant to predicting whether a complaint is substantiated or unsubstantiated. This will help us to build a more accurate and interpretable model.\n",
    "5. Model Selection: After precisely choosing the features that are best suited for our problem, we will undergo a model selection task in an effort to determine the best model for our project. The models in consideration will be:\n",
    "> * K-Nearest Neighbors\n",
    "> * Logistic Regression\n",
    "> * Gradient Boosting\n",
    "> * Random Forest Classifier Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Outlier Detection: We will detect any outliers in the dataset that could potentially impact our model performance and decide on how to handle them.\n",
    "7. Hypothesis Testing: We may conduct hypothesis testing to validate any insights or assumptions made during the EDA process.\n",
    "\n",
    "After conducting this process, we will have clean, well-understood data, and will be ready to begin the development of a classification model that can predict whether the CCRB declared a complaint as substantiated or unsubstantiated, which is described as the recommendation made by the CCRB based on the characteristics of the given complaint. We can compare the predictions made by our model to the actual CCRB recommendations and analyze the discrepancies to determine if there are any consistent patterns or trends in the data that may suggest bias. Furthermore, we can determine which features are found to be the most impactful from the dataset; if these features are discriminatory by nature, it may suggest discrimination within the process. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if our model predicts that a complaint is likely to be substantiated, but the CCRB recommends that it is unsubstantiated, we can investigate the reasons for this discrepancy. We may find that certain factors, such as race or gender, are disproportionately affecting the CCRB's recommendations, which would indicate a potential bias or injustice. We intend to understand exactly how the CCRB punishment categorization is obtained through the likes of our key variables in order to develop an ultimate baseline for police officers to abide by when interacting with the public. These can be seen as guidelines regarding what public actions condemn a reasonable amount of force, what situations call for the need to respect privacy, and when communication between the officer and public offender is the most crucial in order to mitigate the abuse of power. By defining these regulations, we can identify areas where police officers are deviating from their expected behavior, leading to injustices. Through our analysis, we aim to identify the key factors that contribute to inappropriate police behavior, such as excessive use of force, racial profiling, and bias. Our comprehensive set of standards can improve the consequences enforced by agencies like the CCRB when condemning police officers who violate these guidelines, thus promoting better accountability and responsible policing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another important step in our analysis is to address the issue of systematic bias in the data. One way to counter this is by implementing techniques such as oversampling or undersampling to ensure that each category (substantiated or unsubstantiated) has an equal representation in the dataset. However, this can also introduce biases, and so it is important to carefully consider which techniques to use and to evaluate their impact on the model performance. Additionally, we can use methods such as sensitivity analysis to determine the robustness of our results to different sources of bias. By being mindful of the potential sources of bias in our data and taking steps to address them, we can ensure that our analysis accurately reflects the underlying patterns and trends in the data and provides actionable insights for improving police accountability and responsible policing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process above will ultimately guide us towards achieving our goal of determining whether the CCRB is recommending appropriate punishment for NYPD officers accused of abusing their authority. It will also help in the development of a new, system-wide protocol that clearly defines viable actions police officers can perform in a public setting without overstepping the power they possess as law enforcement. Of course, none of this is possible without fitting the best prediction model (with the most appropriate features) to our data at hand and measuring the model’s performance through an F1-score. Only a well-performing model can accurately identify potential biases or injustices in the CCRB's recommendations and use this information to develop a new way of countering police misconduct.\n"

    "- `Allegation`: What the specific allegation was against the officer \n",
    "- `CCRBDiposition`: CCRB’s final evaluation of the complaint \n",
    "- `BoardCat`: Simplified version of CCRB Disposition field \n",

    "- `ImpactedGender`: Self-reported gender of the person impacted in the incident \n",
    "- `ImpactedAge`: Self-reported age of the person impacted in the incident \n",
    "- `ReceivedDate`: Date on which the CCRB received the complaint\n",
    "- `CloseDate`: Date on which the CCRB closed/completed the complaint \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We are predicting the CCRBDisposition variable; In order to simplify this process we will binarize this feature. That is, rather than having many possibilities of outcomes, we will reduce the possibilities to substantiated or unsubstantiated. This makes the prediction task far simpler for the model.\n",
    "We believe that the most critical variables include ContactOutcome, Allegation, and CurrentRank. These features highlight the circumstances of the incident in the most influential terms. The actual allegation against the officer and the contact outcome can determine what had specifically occurred during the scenario. The current rank of the officer can influence how much power that officer holds in the precinct, and in turn may imply a safety net.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding missing values, we cannot confirm that our data retains a normal distribution and due to the nature of the data normalization complicates the approach. As a result, when handling missing values within the data, we will be adding a unique input to represent absent information. For numerical variables, we will replace a missing value with NaN. For categorical variables, since we will be implementing one-hot encoding, we will add another index to represent missing values. For example, a categorical variable with 3 possible responses, would have 4 possible indices, where the fourth index represents missing."

Other features in this portion, such as BoardCat, are a shortened version of the information contained within the CCRBDisposition feature; if we were to leave the features in the dataset, the model could fit to this information with the greatest weight and in turn determine the CCRBDisposition from a column that provides the same information.\n",

    "Now, we want to binarize the values in the `ccrbdisposition` column. There are 25 different actions that the CCRB can recommend in response to a complaint against an officer. However, the decisions can be boiled down to two different categories: 1) whether a claim was substantiated enough to remediate an officer (i.e. dismissal, legal action) or 2) whether a case could not be made to take action against an officer. Thus, we will binarize our variable by either indicating whether a complaint was substantiated (action was taken against an officer) or unsubstantiated (no action was taken against an officer). Thus, the binarization process is shown below."

    "# Proposed Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "As a reminder, our dataset is the “CCRB Complaint Database Raw 04.20.2021.csv“ dataset, which was taken from NYCLU’s GitHub under its NYPD Misconduct Complaint Database repository. An important point to note is that there are 35 columns in the dataset and that more than half of them contain string categorical variables. Also, while the “CCRBDisposition” column contains 25 different actions that the CCRB can take to respond to a complaint, these 25 actions can be boiled down to a binary variable of whether a complaint was “Substantiated” (officer was remediated in some sort of way) or “Not Substantiated” (the officer was not remediated), and this binary variable is what we want to predict. \n",
    "\n",
    "We are not able to reference a benchmark model because there isn't any model that tries to make the predictions that we are striving to make. Since referencing a benchmark model is not appropriate in our case, pivoting to the usage of a baseline mode and using other classifiers would make sense. Given that picking a naive baseline model would result in one of our non-trivial classifierclassifer beating the baseline model's F1-score by default, we, we figured that it would be far more interesting to simply compare the performance of four different classification models. Specifically, for each model, we will select the features that have the most weight in predicting whether a complaint is substantiated or unsubstantiated by using the Eli5 Python library. Then, we will compare each optimized model and examine which one has the highest F1-score.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first classification algorithm will be K-Nearest Neighbors using the relevant features mentioned above to predict whether a complaint against a police officer was substantiated or unsubstantiated. K-Nearest Neighbors is an algorithm that we will use to check if the complaints areis substantiated or unsubstantiated because the we can analyze the binary outcome of whether the result of each complaint is leaning more towards substantiated or unsubstantiated based on the distance towards the result of each complaint.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our second classification algorithm will be logistic regression using the relevant features mentioned above to predict whether a complaint against a police officer was substantiated or unsubstantiated. Logistic regression is a suitable algorithm for predicting binary outcomes like ours, and can be used to estimate the probability of a substantiated or unsubstantiated outcome based on our many predictor variables. More specifically, we can use logistic regression to analyze the relationship between our most relevant features and the likelihood of a complaint being substantiated or not. By modeling our outcomes through the use of the Eli5 Python package, we can determine the most influential variables in predicting our overall outcome, and potentially use that information to generalize to policymakers when it comes to substantiated complaints about the police. Additionally, logistic regression models have the advantage of being relatively easy to interpret, so once feature selection is completed, it should not be very difficult to extract our most important features and focus on those when eventually running our models.and, more importantly, can be used as a stepping stone to perform \n",
    "\n",
    "Our third classification algorithm will be gradient boosting using the relevant features mentioned above to predict whether a complaint against a police officer was substantiated or unsubstantiated. Gradient boosting is another suitable outcome for oubinary problems, especially since the relationship between our predictor and outcome variables are complex and non-linear. It can arguably handle high-dimensional data in a more efficient way than logistic regression, which will be crucial when it comes to the processing time of our large data set. Similar to logistic regression, we will be able to use this algorithm to process our most important features and analyze the relationship between them and our outcome variable (and, compare these results to what was found using KNN and logistic regression). We can also use gradient boosting to balance the number of instances belonging to each class. For example, there could be a high number of complaints that are substantiated compared to those that are not, leading to an imbalanced and biased model that is more accurate in predicting the majority class as opposed to the minority class. Gradient boosting can handle this by assigning higher weights to the misclassified instances, leading to a much more accurate and fair model that will better generalize to unseen data. utomatically select the most important features when predicting our final outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "Our fourth classification algorithm will be the random forest classifier algorithm using the relevant features mentioned above to predict whether a complaint against a police officer was substantiated or unsubstantiated. In terms of the libraries that would be most relevant to our project, scikit-learn has a module called ensemble, which contains the random forest classifier algorithm. Furthermore, we will also be using the train_test_split package under scikit-learn to split the training data and test data from each other. In terms of what makes a random forest classifier a good choice for our problem, it handles class imbalance and missing values in a different way than our other algorithms. We can utilize balanced subsampling to counter the effects of class imbalance that were described previously, and has the ability to process missing values in our dataset while in the act of training, saving us a lot of time (unlike logistic regression and gradient boosting, where we have to impute or one-hot encode our variables during the preprocessing stage). Random forest classifiers also have fewer hyperparameters for us to tune while still providing interpretable importance scores in regards to our selected features, adding to its efficiency and usefulness when considering how complex our data is."

    "We will be using the F1-score due to how it is a balance of the precision and recall scores. Both precision and recall are especially important to the context and one should not be chosen over the other; attempting to maintain a high precision rate will let us know that we are able to more accurately predict complaints that are actually substantiated. A high recall rate will let us know that we are able to accurately predict complaints that are not substantiated, which means that . To calculate the Precision and Recall scores, we have the following formulas…\n",

    "The detriments of having either a low precision or low recall score also illustrates why both are equally important. Having low precision rate means that we are unnecessarily taking actions against police officers for a complaint that is actually unsubstantiated. On the other hand, having a low recall rate means that we are overlooking a complaint that can be utilized to discipline an officer who abused their authority. Thus, since both precision and recall are equally important to the context of this question, the F1-score, which is a harmonic mean of both metrics, will be utilized.\n"

However, we notice that the `impactedage` column, which represents the column of each complainant's age, has a value over 200. We may need to take a close eye into this situation and find a way to handle this excessive case, since the oldest person in the world is currently 116 years old."

    "Similar to the `daysonforce` column, we immediately notice that there appear to be negative values present when representing values in the `impactedage` column, which illustrates the number of days that the officer to whom the complaint is targetted has been on the Police Force. According to the NYCLU, negative values in this case can account for a variety of reasons, including data entry errors, ambiguous or missing date of birth, and alleged misconduct occurring before the complainant's birth. The problem on our end is that we can't assume what reason each individual has regarding why they have a negative value for the number of days that they have been on the police force. In order to make a decision regarding how we deal with negative values, we take note of the fact that less than 200 rows in the `ccrb` dataset have negative values for the `impactedage` column. However, we also know that there are extrememley high values that were utilized to represent the ages of people. We notice that there are only two rows that have age values greater than 116. So, we decided to drop the two rows, since dropping two rows out of hundreds of thousands of remaining rows will have almost no effect on the model."

    "Next, we separated the categorical columns from the numeric columns by keepin column names into two different lists. However, the `ccrbdisposition` column was not counted as a categorical column because we only wanted to include features into these two lists; as a reminder, we are predicting a binarized version of the `ccrbdisposition` column. We created a Cross-Tabulation Table that will show a list of unique values for each feature coupled with a list of the number of occurrences of that value. This allows us to get a better understanding of what values may arise within the dataset, and if there is a skew within the variables. For example, when looking at the values for IncidentRankLong, we can see that 192,825 of the values in this feature are for police officers. This suggests that most of the complaints within the dataset are filed against a lower ranking officer."

    "We see that the correlation coefficient value for `daysonforce` and `impactedage` is 0.058. This idea implies that while we do see a positive correlation between the two variables, they aren't necessarily causal. Now, we want to be able to examine the correlation between the categorical columns. This task is quite tricky because we need to be able to utilize the string values in the categorical columns to showcase correlation among each other. So, we convert the column names into numeric codes and then use a Pearson correlation to examine the correlation among the different categorical columns. Thus, the correlation coefficient values can be seen below."

    "Since we converted the categorical variables into numeric codes, we are able to utilize a method that is normally reserved for continuous variables. The correlation coefficient values from above range from -1 to +1, where -1 indicates a perfect negative correlation and +1 indicates a negative correlation. For instance, we can see that `contactoutcome`, which we predicted to be a critical variable, and `ccrbdisposition` have a correlation coefficient value of -0.025694, which implies a negative relationship. One important note to keep in mind is that because we are attempting to use a Pearson correlation on categorical variables, the interpretation of correlation coefficients in this case is merely limited to linear relationships. While categorical variables can have other types of relationships, like nonlinear, the correlation coefficients above won't be able to catch those relationships."

We then aimed to show which features were the most influential. We did this by printing the features that were given the most weight within the model. After ordering the features by order of their weight, we can determine the top five features that have the most weight in predicting whether the CCRB determines a complaint to be substantiated or unsubstantiated. We can see that the most influential feature, when considering if the complaint is substantiated or not, is dependent on the race of the impacted person and the type of allegation against the officer.

    "The first ethical concern that may be realized is with regards to the exposure of the officer’s identity. If the project were to be put to use, the names and identifiable features of the officers would be easily accessed and in turn this leads to a violation of privacy for the officers. When conducting the analysis, factors such as the name of the officer or the officer ID is not expected to greatly impact the task at hand for the model; in order to protect the privacy of the officers we can exclude these features from the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the dataset is generated by complaints made against police officers; in order for a complaint to be filed there must have been some interaction between an officer and a civilian. However,  it can be seen that there are cases where specific, notably marginalized, communities see far greater police interaction than others which can lead to a greater amount of complaints made within certain communities and from marginalized backgrounds. As a result, there may be an implicit bias within the dataset. Despite these concerns, we are confident that the data is still reliable to use for the project. Firstly, we can use the data to uncover discrimination throughout the process. In order to do this, we must analyze the data from the source and identify key features. Furthermore, we are confident that the data comes from a reliable source, ensuring that the information has not been tampered with or altered.\n",

    "Lastly, we understand that there may be possible unethical byproducts that can arise from the use of the project. For example, it may be the case that the model, as a result of implicit bias in the data, finds a complaint to be substantiated due to features such as age or race. In the event the model were to be put to use, there is a concern for similar ethical violations to that of Predictive Policing.\n",
    "We can use this model to reveal a possible bias by highlighting which variables are most influential in deciding the outcome; the model can reveal that certain, hypothetically less important features in this decision process, are more impactful than others. Examples of these variables include race, age, gender, and more. If these variables are shown to be influential, it can suggest that the outcome is determined with a bias towards or against these discriminatory beliefs. "
